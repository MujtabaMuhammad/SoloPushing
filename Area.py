You now own some property and you want to calculate the total area of the property.
Create a program that:

    Reads the width and height
    Prints the area

    Example: width = 5, height = 2
    Output: total_area = 10
'''


def area(width, height):
    A = width * height
    print("Area is equal to : " + str(A))


area(2, 4)
